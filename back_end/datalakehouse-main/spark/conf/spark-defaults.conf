# These are fallback defaults; actual values come from environment variables:
# See Dockerfile entrypoint.sh for dynamic configuration of:
# - Iceberg catalog (postgres connection, credentials)
# - MinIO/S3 endpoint and credentials
# - Warehouse path
# All credentials are read from .env file via docker-compose
